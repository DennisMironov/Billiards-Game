# Billiards Game
A web-server-based billiards game for 2 players playing on the same device.

## Features
- Full billiards game functionality and logic
- Accurate physics calcuations that are done server-side
- Uses SVG data from each calculated shot to produce an animation of the shot

## Usage
Currently, there is no accessible way to play this game. Requires the server to be hosted on Linux; only tested on a Linux docker image provided by the University of Guelph.
An easier way to access and play the game is planned.

## Roadmap
Potential features that are being looked into and may be included in the future.
- More accessible way to run the program and play the game
- Various bug fixes
- Save / load game states (using existing SQL database functionality)
- Further optimize database operations
- Display showing which balls belong to which player
- Settings to tailor the gameplay
